            Kamal Coffee began with a simple idea: keep the soul of Vietnamese iced coffee,
            but make it easier—and kinder—for everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
            We source bold Vietnamese robusta and pair it with an oat-milk condensed milk,
            then sweeten with allulose for a smooth, modern finish. It’s authentic, elevated,
            and beautifully simple.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            To share the joy of cà phê sữa đá with everyone—without compromise.
            That means clean ingredients, thoughtful design, and a drinking experience
            that’s as effortless as it is delightful.
          </p>
          <h3>What we value</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> honoring Vietnamese coffee culture.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> fewer ingredients, better choices.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect:</strong> for people, farmers, and the planet.</li>
          </ul>
